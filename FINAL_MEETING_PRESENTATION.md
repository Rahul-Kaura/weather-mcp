## 🚀 **Advanced Features That Make You Stand Out**

### **1. Weather Analytics & Intelligence**
```go
// Weather scoring algorithm
func getWeatherScore(condition string, tempC float64, humidity int, windKph float64) (int, string) {
    score := 5 // Base score
    
    // Temperature scoring
    if tempC >= 18 && tempC <= 25 {
        score += 3 // Perfect temperature
    }
    
    // Condition scoring
    if strings.Contains(conditionLower, "sunny") {
        score += 2
    }
    
    return score, description
}
```

### **2. Real-Time Safety Alerts**
```go
// Weather alert system
func getWeatherAlert(condition string, tempC float64, windKph float64, humidity int) string {
    if strings.Contains(conditionLower, "thunder") {
        return "⚡ **WEATHER ALERT:** Thunderstorm detected - seek shelter immediately!"
    } else if tempC > 35 {
        return "🔥 **HEAT ALERT:** Extreme heat - stay hydrated!"
    }
    return ""
}
```

### **3. Travel & Tourism Intelligence**
```go
// City-specific travel advice
switch cityLower {
case "tokyo":
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🚇 **Local Tip:** Use the efficient subway system")
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🍜 **Food Tip:** Try local ramen shops")
case "london":
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🚇 **Local Tip:** Get an Oyster card for public transport")
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "☕ **Food Tip:** Experience traditional afternoon tea")
}
```

### **4. Personalized Recommendations Engine**
```go
// Smart recommendations based on weather
if tempC > 30 {
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🌡️ Stay hydrated and avoid prolonged sun exposure")
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🏊 Perfect weather for swimming or water activities")
} else if strings.Contains(conditionLower, "rain") {
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "☔ Bring an umbrella or raincoat")
    recommendations = append(recommendations, "🏛️ Perfect for museum visits and indoor attractions")
}
```
